# Spotify-Inspired-Web-Music-Player
– Developed a Spotify-inspired music player using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript, featuring a dynamic playlist rendered from a JavaScript array, with song titles and cover    art populated in the UI.
– Implemented audio playback controls—including play/pause toggling, next/previous track navigation, and a synchronized seek bar that updates in real time via the HTML Audio       API’s timeupdate events.
– Enhanced user experience with responsive UI elements: Font Awesome icons for controls, a GIF animation indicator during playback, and styled layouts using Flexbox for both the   song list and sticky bottom controller.
